Dabo IDE: Tools for Building Dabo Applications Visually
==========

### **NOTE: these tools were written around 20 years ago for a much older version of Dabo that used a much older version of wxPython for its UI. As such, they really don't work that well today, but it would be nice to someday get them working again.**


One tool that is working is the **Connection Editor** (cxn_editor.py) - this will help you to define connection information files to your database.

The **Class Designer** (class_designer.py) seems to be very buggy, and crashes randomly. It is not recommeneded.
